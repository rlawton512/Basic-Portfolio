<h1> About Me </h1>
<img src = "assets/images/profile.jpg">

<p>I’m Raven, a web developer based in Charlotte, NC.  I consider myself a lifelong learner who continuously lives outside my comfort zone.  After several years in the real estate finance industry, my newest passion is coding.  I always wanted to become fluent in a second language.  I just didn’t know back then that language would be computer programming. 
<br> 
Outside of coding, I have an intense love and passion for food.  If I’m not enjoying a good meal with my family or friends, I can usually be found reading, meditating, or playing!  </p>
